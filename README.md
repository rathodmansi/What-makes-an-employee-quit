This repository contains a human-centered data science analysis on understanding the factors that influence an employee to quit their job. It contains a thorough exlporatory data analysis on what are the key reasons that make an employee leave and if there are possible indicators (existing or engineered during the course of analysis) that can help us predict employee attrition beforehand. From McKinseys article on People Analytics, I gathered that People Analytics based insights reduces employee attrition by 50% and improves business efficiency by 25%. According to Nucleus Research for every dollar invested in people analytics organisations receive a return of 13.01 dollars [2]. Even while going through Visier's website [3], I found more about the importance of performing People Analytics and what benefits it brings. In almost all of the articles that I read, I could see one topic repeating, it was: Employee Attrition or Retention. Every big organisation out there is now investing time to reduce employee attrition and improve employee satisfactions. In my analysis I want to focus on what are the factors that make an employee satisfied or happy. Based on this, I want to develop my action items or plans to organisation.

My Motivation to pursue this project comes from my 2 years of professional work experience as a Business Analyst for OYO, a travel & hospitality related startup. I handled their Sales Operation Analaytics and was the owner for Incentives and Performance Management project during this time. With this project, I want to further explore into the causes of what makes an employe satisfied or unsatisfied with his/her organization. Specifically in this project, we look into employee attrition and identify indicators leading to it. This project is interesting from any organisation's purview because companies not only invest money but time and resources in grooming and training their employees. A single employee's resignation is not only a loss of head count but also a loss in terms of times, money and bandwidth. Complementing to this view, the project is also employee-centered and analyzes reasons for attrition from an employee's point of view.

### Directory Structure

The directory is divided into three sections:

1. <b>1-Data:</b> This section contains our dataset used for the analysis
2. <b>2-Analysis Code:</b> This section contains the python code where we have analysed our research questions and generated insights
3. <b> 3-Output images:</b> This section contains all the output figures from which conclusions have been drawn.

### Data
<br>

For my analysis, I wanted a simpler data and one publicly available. I came across this Kaggel Data Challenge: HR Data for Analytics. Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jacksonchou/hr-data-for-analytics.

The data is publicly available and under the CC0: Public Domain license.The dataset contains employee profiles of a large company, where each record is an employee. It has the follwoing columns available:

    satisfaction_level
    last_evaluation
    number_project
    average_montly_hours
    time_spend_company
    Work_accident
    left
    promotion_last_5years
    sales
    salary
    

### Unknown Dependency
<br>

The above dataset contains only 10 features and has the information for a limited time duration only. So, our analysis will be limited to the insights from these 10 features only. But I belive, this should still give us important insights and answer our research questions.

Other than the above, I havn't come acorss any factor or limitations that would hamper the progress of this project.
